# Hoi I'm Ezat, or more commonly known as Valzur! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I graduated from Zewail City of Science & Technology, Aerospace Engineering on 2022.. but had already decided game dev is my thing since 2020.
I generally love programming, and i've been using C# for scripting in the Unity Game Engine since 2019.
I recently started experimenting with C++ on my Pinball original project and the Remake version.
I also have a bit of experience with Flutter and dart.

## Other Common Github Profile Sections
👩‍💻 I'm currently working on 3 projects:
- Pinball Remake (in C++)
- Shooter Game (in UE4)
- Portfolio webpage (in Flutter)

🧠 I'm currently learning Unreal Engine, and experimenting with the engine and the work flow generally.

👯‍♀️ I'm open to collaborate in any Game Jams
